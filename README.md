<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## What I Learned:

The goal for this project is to use Hack or Snooze API to clone this app. Functionalies including creating an account, logging in, creating a post, favoriting/unfavoriting posts, viewing favorite posts, viewing and deleting my posts, and viewing and updating account information. With knowledge in object oriented programming in javascript, I was able to implement all these functions with separate concerns in mind. Functions that are for the users to view are in ui.js vs ones for behind the scene in app.js file. 


### Stretch Goal:

I'd like to further refactor my code to specifically handle errors that arise when user tries to create an account with a username that's already been taken. I'd also like to use the API response to make error messages displayed to the user more specific (for both account creation and login).
